### 1. Conceiving The Purpose of Software

First of all, you should understand the purpose of the software. There is, in fact, a single purpose of all software: **To help people**.

> Remember: the purpose of the software is not to show off how
>intelligent you are. — Max Kanat-Alexander, Code Simplicity.

Developers who cannot conceive the purpose of the software will write bad software. What is bad software? A complex system that doesn’t help people that much.

When you are making decisions about software, you should guide yourself by always keeping this in mind: How we can help? You can even prioritize feature requests this way.

### 2. The Goals of Software Design

#### Every programmer is a designer

When software is hard to create or modify, developers spend most of their time focusing on making things “just work,” and less time focusing on helping users. The design of software aims to make developers job as easy as possible so they can focus on what matters. You will create software that will help users and your software will continue to help them for a long time

However, if you design a bad system, your software’s lifetime will be short

>To design systems that can be created and maintained as easily as
>possible by their developers, so that they can be — and continue to be — as
>helpful as possible. — Max Kanat-Alexander, Code Simplicity

### 3. Simplicity

>_Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. — Leonardo da Vinci_

Programming is the act of reducing complexity to simplicity. A “bad developer” is just somebody who fails to reduce complexity. A “good developer” is doing everything in their power to make the code as simple as possible for other programmers.

A good developer creates things that are easy to understand so that it’s really easy to shake out all the bugs.

Now, developers are generally intelligent people and none of them likes to be treated like they are idiots. Ironically, this leads them sometimes to create things that are a bit complicated. They basically think like this:

“_Oh, other developers will understand everything I’ve done here. I should write some clever code that is hard to understand so that they can think that I am very smart._”

A mistake caused by a wrong mindset-not necessarily by a lack of programming skills. Most of the programming failures happen because of that mentality.

Showing off that you are smart doesn’t help them.

Developers who are new to your code don’t know anything about it; **they have to learn**.

So, you should ask this question: “Do I want people to understand this and be happy, or do I want them to be confused and frustrated?”

The truth is that if other developers who read your code can understand it easily it means that you are doing good.

>Complexity has nothing to do with intelligence, simplicity does. — Larry Bossidy

The question is: “How simple do you have to be?”

Here is your answer: **_Stupid, dumb simple_**.

### 4. Maintenance

Maintenance is one of the most important things in software development. Unfortunately, developers usually ignore how important it is. Quick coding and fast shipping look more important than code maintenance. This is the point where they make a mistake — ignorance of future code maintenance.

There will always be some implementation of changes. Not only you have to implement them, but you also have to maintain them over time. As a developer, thinking about future maintenance of changes is one of your main responsibilities.

>All changes require maintenance.

<br />

>Simplicity and complexity are the two main factors that affect code maintenance. The ease of maintenance of any piece of software is proportional to the simplicity of its individual pieces. The effort of maintenance is proportional to the complexity of the software.

<br />

>The one rule that you should follow about maintenance is:

<br />

>>**It is more important to reduce the effort of maintenance than it is to reduce the effort of implementation**.

<br />
