### 1. Conceiving The Purpose of Software

There are Purposes from the programs, but the main Purpose is to **help people**.

> Remember: the purpose of the software is not to show off how
>intelligent you are.

The main objective of software development is to portray the software well.

As a developer, you must set goals for the development of the application by asking about the required features in it.

### 2. The Goals of Software Design

#### Every programmer is a designer

Only allow program running or modification. The application is made to make the work of developers as simple as possible for up to two years, allowing them to concentrate on the crucial matters. You'll develop a program to assist them, and your program will carry on assisting them.

If you design a bad program, make sure that it will have a short life.

>To design systems that can be created and maintained as easily as
>possible by their developers, so that they can be — and continue to be — as helpful as possible.

### 3. Simplicity

The main goal for the success of applications is to be uncomplicated so that the user can use them easily and can access everything without complexity.

**This is one of the characteristics of a good programmer**.

>Complexity has nothing to do with intelligence, simplicity does.

### 4. Maintenance

Maintenance of the application is the most important way to improve it, but many ignore the importance of this step, as they focus on completing the project as soon as possible.

One of the most important characteristics of developers is to focus on thinking about the future in terms of maintenance and so on.

>All changes require maintenance.
<br/>
>Simplicity and complexity are the two main factors that affect code maintenance. The ease of maintenance of any piece of software is proportional to the simplicity of its individual pieces. The effort of maintenance is proportional to the complexity of the software.
